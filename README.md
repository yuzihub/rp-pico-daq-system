# Data Acquisition System for Raspberry Pi-Pico
This data acquisition system reads data from two microphones sampled at 20 kHz each and reads IMU data (acceleration and gyro) at 100 Hz each. The code can be modified to read from different sensors at different speeds. As it is, it will allow the Raspberry Pi Pico (RP Pico) to read from BMI160 model IMU sensor and perform two analog read operations for analog microphones. The system writes all data to SD card. For better analog read accuracy, especially for microphones, an amplifier system, a stable power source and a voltage reference is recommended. The code can be uploaded to RP Pico via the Arduino IDE. The SDK used in this project can be found in this [link](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk). The HAL for the board is from [earlephilhower](https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico)'s arduino-pico repository. The SD library is [here](https://github.com/greiman/SdFat). The RTC DS3231 uses [this](https://github.com/rodan/ds3231) library.
